# Calories Burnt Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## 1. Problem Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the number of calories burnt by individuals during exercise based on a variety of features, including user demographics and exercise details. Using machine learning, we aim to build a model that accurately predicts calorie expenditure from input features.

## 2. Data Overview

### a. **Calories Dataset**:
- Contains two columns:
  - `User_ID`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `Calories`: The number of calories burnt by the user.

### b. **Exercise Dataset**:
- Contains several columns related to user characteristics and exercise metrics:
  - `User_ID`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `Gender`: Male or female.
  - `Age`: The age of the individual in years.
  - `Height`: User's height in centimeters.
  - `Weight`: User's weight in kilograms.
  - `Duration`: Duration of the exercise session in minutes.
  - `Heart_Rate`: The average heart rate during the exercise session.
  - `Body_Temp`: Body temperature during the session (in degrees Celsius).

## 3. Data Preprocessing

### a. **Data Merging**:
- The `calories.csv` and `exercise.csv` datasets are merged based on the `User_ID` column to form a complete dataset containing both user characteristics and calorie data.

### b. **Handling Missing Values**:
- Ensure there are no missing values in critical columns like `Duration`, `Heart_Rate`, or `Calories`. Any missing values are either imputed or removed depending on the context.

### c. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
- The `Gender` column is converted from categorical to numerical format (0 for Female, 1 for Male).

### d. **Feature Scaling**:
- Features like `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Duration`, `Heart_Rate`, and `Body_Temp` may need to be scaled using either normalization or standardization for models like linear regression to ensure uniformity.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### a. **Distribution of Calories Burnt**
A histogram or distribution plot helps visualize the distribution of the target variable, `Calories`. This plot can show whether the calories burnt are normally distributed, skewed, or have outliers.

- You can create this plot using:
  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.histplot(calories_df['Calories'], kde=True)
### b. **Correlation Matrix**:
- A heatmap of correlations between variables helps identify which features are most strongly related to the target variable (`Calories`). Features with high correlation, such as `Duration` and `Heart_Rate`, are expected to play a significant role in prediction.

## 5. Linear Regression

### a. **Model Description**:
Linear regression is used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (calories burnt). It assumes a linear relationship and aims to predict the target variable as a weighted sum of the input features.

The general equation for linear regression is:

\[
Calories = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Duration + \beta_2 \cdot Heart\_Rate + \beta_3 \cdot Body\_Temp + \dots + \epsilon
\]

Where:
- \(\beta_0\) is the intercept.
- \(\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots\) are the coefficients (weights) for the features.
- \(\epsilon\) is the error term (residual).

### b. **Steps in Model Development**:
1. **Data Splitting**:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets, usually in an 80-20 or 70-30 ratio. The training set is used to train the linear regression model, while the testing set evaluates its performance.
   
2. **Model Fitting**:
   - The linear regression model is trained using features like `Duration`, `Heart_Rate`, `Body_Temp`, and other relevant variables from the exercise dataset.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Penalizes larger errors by squaring them.
   - **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of the variance in calories burnt that is predictable from the features. An R² value close to 1 indicates a good model fit.

### c. **Limitations of Linear Regression**:
- **Assumes Linearity**: Linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship between features and calories burnt, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios.
- **Outliers**: Extreme values in variables like `Heart_Rate` or `Body_Temp` can disproportionately affect model performance.
- **Multicollinearity**: Features like `Weight` and `Height` may be correlated, which can affect the reliability of coefficient estimates in linear regression.

This concludes the detailed steps leading up to the implementation of linear regression. The model can now be evaluated to understand its performance, and further enhancements can be made by trying more advanced algorithms if necessary.
